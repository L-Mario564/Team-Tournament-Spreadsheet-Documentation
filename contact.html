        <h1>Contact</h1>
        <p>Want to contact me to report a bug, suggest a feature, or contribute to the spreadsheet or the documentation website? This is the place to do so. I'd like to keep improving and fixing the project as much as I can.</p>
        <p>You're free to contact me as long as you follow these rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must have a valid reason to contact me. I won't take suggestions relating to visuals or code formatting.</li>
            <li>You must describe your report with detail. I can't help you if your report is vague.</li>
            <li>If your report is about the spreadsheet, give information about the sheets, scripts and / or ranges that are related to your issue.</li>
            <li>If you're suggesting a feature, make sure it isn't already in place.</li>
            <li>If you're suggesting a feature, you must describe how it would improve the project.</li>
        </ul><br>
